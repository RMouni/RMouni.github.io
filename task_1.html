			The exploration of space stands as one of humanity’s greatest achievements. 
			While history has hailed the men and women who reached the cosmos, and those
			who helped them get there, much of the infrastructure that sent them skyward 
			lies forgotten and dilapidated.And how does Apple’s biggest phone compare to 
			the Note Edge? Well, both remain unwieldy to grip, and the Note Edge is wider. 
			However, the edged screen nuzzles into my hand better and those software tweaks 
			mentioned above give it the advantage.

			However, just like the stylus, there’s a while before you get the knack of all 
			the little provisions Samsung’s made to ease users into this screen size.
			Roland Miller has spent nearly half his life chronicling these landmarks before 
			they are lost forever long been obsessed with space as a child, he dreamed of being

			Sony has started rolling out a new update to its Xperia XZ and X Performance smartphones. 
			It’s a minor, bug-fixing update that bumps the build number from 39.2.A.0.361 to version 39.2.A.0.374.
		</p>
		<p style="padding:20px">
			This is the second update that has been rolled out to these devices ever since they received Nougat. 
			The last update brought along Android security fixes for the month of December.
			As is usually the case with OTA roll outs, it may take sometime for the update notification to pop up
			on your device’s screen. Meanwhile, if you feel impatient, you can manually check for the update by 
			heading to the Settings menu on your handset.

				The ability to shrink the likes of Chrome and Google Maps to a popup window and layer 
				it on top of other apps is also useful.
				Love to see something similar on the iPhone 6 Plus you just get the Note 4 anyway?		
				Despite the unusual, curved screen, it still packs all of the good things that made
				the Note 4 such a strong choice. But bragging rights aside, is there enough of an 
				argument for a curved screen.

				The screen is marginally smaller than the Note 4, despite the cranked-up pixel count. Like the Note 4, text pops a little more, and pictures you take with the 16MP camera are obviously better replicated on the Note Edge’s screen.

				All told, it’s an excellent camera. The image stabilizing works well on all the neon lights that pepper Tokyo, while even people were neatly captured. There’s some noise, but it compares favorably against older Galaxy phones. 
				Daylight meant effortless captures and some really nice shots, if I say so myself.
